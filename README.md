This project is a web-based Quiz Game built using Python programming and the Flask framework.
It dynamically loads trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API, displays them to users one at a time, collects answers, and shows the final score after 10 questions.
The user interface is designed with embedded HTML/CSS, providing a smooth and interactive quiz experience in the browser. 
The project demonstrates Pythonâ€™s capabilities in web development, API integration, form handling, and dynamic routing.
